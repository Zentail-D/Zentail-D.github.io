						<h3>Where I'm From</h3>
						<p>
							I'm from a small city in Northwestern Ohio where I've lived my entire life. I've traveled around the US and some of my earliest childhood memories were late nights in the RV playing games like Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and Mass Effect. I've helped out at the family business from a young age where I've operated heavy machinery and worked since I was around 9 years old.
						</p>
						<h3>Why I Develop</h3>
						<p>
							Working in construction growing up gave me an appreciation for how hard the generations prior worked to give me the choices I have today. I don't want to waste the chance I've been given doing something I hate so I decided to pursue my dreams of working in the game industry. 
							I've played games since I was young when my health wouldn't let me play sports but games didn't click with me until I tried Star Wars Galaxies for the first time in 2004. After I logged in and saw the vast open-world I could have an effect on just like Han and Chewie I was hooked. After I realized how much fun games could be I played everything I could get my hands on but nothing compared to the intricate world of MMORPGs or the immersive feel of FPSs. 
							I had a wonderful experience growing up in guilds online with my brother. We grew up going to school and work but then we'd come home to these communities where we were able to constantly debate about what we would do to make our favorite  games better. When I became older I realized I wanted to make games for other people to enjoy and make lifelong friends the same way I had.
						</p>
						<h3>How I started</h3>
						<p>
							My first journey into making content for games started when I found forge mode on Halo 3. This was the first game to pull me away from MMOs on my PC and I would spend hundreds of hours on my Xbox making maps for my brother and his friends to play. After this, I ventured into creating games for school projects using RPGMaker but I stopped using it after I realized how little fun I had writing dialog after I was done creating my levels and combat encounters. It was around this time in middle school that I discovered the DayZ mod for Arma II and realized that you could create content for existing games the same way I used to for Halo 3. After this, I started modding every game I could get my hands on so I could see what people were creating for these games that weren't part of the base experience. 
                            I realized that some of my favorite game series at this point like Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and Arma had diverse modding communities that made tons of content and I had to be a part of it. I started by talking with mod teams at community events on different forums like ModDB, Steam, and Reddit where I'd try to get into meetings where I could make my design ideas heard. This is where I started to learn my first lessons in design because as a child I didn't have a concept of how difficult it was to make mods and games. I realized pretty fast that I was in over my head but I dug into Arma III and started creating scenarios, operations, and cosmetic mods for Arma's player communities. 
                            My Arma modding days lasted until college when I started going to school for Computer Science so I could learn to program the games I'd wanted to design my whole life. I went to Bowling Green State University for a while but I couldn't stand the program and one day while I was playing with my WoW guild I heard someone talk about a game design college in Ohio. This is how I found Shawnee State University and I transferred immediately into their game design degree.
