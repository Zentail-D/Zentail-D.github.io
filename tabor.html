								<h3>The Project's Goal</h3>
								<p>
									Combat Waffle Studios is making a Russsian Post-Apocoliptic extraction shooter in VR. The game is very similar to Escape from Tarkov where players will jump into raids to complete missions, loot weapons and gear to sell, and participate in PvP.
								</p>
								<h3>Summary of my Work</h3>
								<ol>
                                    <li>Designed and tested NERDS medical system to solve the issue of an in-depth healing system in VR</li>

                                    <li>Managed 15 developers in week long sprints to meet monthly deadlines set by myself, the lead developer, and the CEO</li>
                                    
                                    <li>Designed and created tools to streamline map creation using blueprint scripting in Unreal Engine 4.27</li>
                                </ol>
								<h3>What Did I Do</h3>
								<p>
                                    My primary role was Project Manager but with the team being small I performed numerous roles. I managed the day to day tasks for 15 developers and worked with our senior developers, lead developers, and CEO to set sprint goals and monthly milestones. 
                                    I also acted as a designer on the project where I assisted in level designed and designed game systems like the NERDS medical system. I assisted in the development of Missile Silo where I connected the map by making new hallways on each floor to make the map more interconnected 
                                    to assist in player movement. I also developed tools that were used in the repetitive placement of assets in Missile Silo and Island of Tabor.
                                    
                                    Tabors medical system faced platform issues in how players healed in VR games, players can't perform medical operations on anything below the waist due do the only consistent tracking being attached to players head and hands. This means players can't bend over to 
                                    operate on half of their body due to the limitation in VR. I took the games setting into account to design a way around this limitation, Tabor takes place in the future so I based the NERDS injectors off of nanoprobes found most sci-fi media. The injector is inserted into the players injection port 
                                    and from there the player will be able to pick what limb the nanoprobes focus on repairing. This lets players heal any of their limbs in VR by only requiring them to use their hands and still requires them to take time to heal since the entire process isn't automated.
