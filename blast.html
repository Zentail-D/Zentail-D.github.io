						<h3>What is B.L.A.S.T.</h3>
						<p>
							Blast is a pitch for the 2022 senior project; a group of artists and programmers were tasked with creating a game in 16 months. Its acronym stood for Bullet, Laser, Alien, Snake, Taco, and was pitched as a single-player roguelike fps inspired by games like Doom and Gunfire Reborn. 
                            The game changed throughout preproduction as all the students gave their input into what they wanted to develop. It became a multiplayer arena-based shooter with PvPvE elements made in Unreal Engine 4.26. After the preproduction ended, the game shifted from a roguelike where the objective was to 
                            clear one level at a time to an arena shooter that aimed to take Doom's combat, Duke Nukem's comedy, and Titanfall's movement. Professors weren't allowed to give the class technical guidance on the project, so we were entirely on our own to come up with the best game we could after the guided preproduction period ended.

								<h3>What Did I Do</h3>
								<p>
									At the end of the project, I oversaw the level design, gameplay design, system design, and programming. First, I designed a zone system that broke the level into zones streamed in as the players moved throughout. After this, I created 3 of 5 zones from paper block-outs to the finished product alone. During this, I also assisted other level designers by populating their zones 
                                    with foliage and asset compositions and doing QA and terrain passes to ensure the zones flowed together nicely. I also designed our power-up weapon system where players would get new temporary firing modes for their guns by killing enemies. I also created basic AI where enemy types would interact with the player and move differently. Lastly, I also designed 
                                    and prototyped the movement system; although it didn't align with the game's vision, the team simplified movement afterward. The movement ended up having walking with jumping, sprinting, sliding, and crouching to keep in line with the run-and-gun experience we wanted to deliver.

								<h3>Postmortem</h3>
								<p>
									I learned a lot from working on BLAST, and I think some of the most important lessons I had were communication, clear documentation, leadership structure, expectations, scope, and honesty. If we had more communication, our team wouldn't have fallen months behind schedule, and we might not have had to cut out half 
                                    of the art. With clear documentation, our assets and systems wouldn't have been delayed in the pipeline or needed an overhaul. A better leadership structure would have made our leads more accountable, myself included. We had a lot of times when no one on the team had any idea what we were doing or if we 
                                    had a plan in mind. There were a lot of minimum expectations at the start of each milestone, but there wasn't a maximum. With some people overperforming, our underachievers become comfortable hiding behind others which created a lot of tension. The tension made teams miserable since the rest of the project wasn't always carrying their weight.
                                    We underestimated how much we could get done in a short amount of time and overestimated everyone's willingness to work. Teams crunching in the office space for 12-14 hours a day while others aren't working over 3 hours made many of the team bitter towards one another. Lastly, people needed to 
                                    be more honest all over the group. Everyone should have spoken up when they needed help with burnout instead of lying about how much work they put into the project.
